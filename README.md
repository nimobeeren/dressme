## Repository Structure

This repo contains two primary components:

- 📁 [`api`](./api): the backend API
- 📁 [`client`](./client): the frontend client

<!-- TODO: move the API into the client directory -->

Each component has its own README with more specific information.

Next to that, there are some secondary directories:

- 📁 [`.github`](./.github): GitHub Actions CI configuration
- 📁 [`images`](./images): some sample images useful for seeding the development database
